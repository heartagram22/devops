Introduction
This Terraform code provisions infrastructure in Azure for a DevOps project. It creates a resource group, a container registry, a virtual network with a subnet, and two virtual machines with network interfaces. The virtual machines run Ubuntu 16.04 and have Docker installed. The code also creates an agent pool for the container registry.

Requirements
Terraform 1.0 or later
Azure subscription
Azure CLI
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.
Run az login to authenticate with your Azure account.
Run terraform init to initialize Terraform.
Run terraform plan to preview the changes that will be made.
Run terraform apply to apply the changes to your Azure subscription.
Inputs
location: The location where the resources will be created.
vm_size: The size of the virtual machines.
admin_username: The username for the virtual machines.
admin_password: The password for the virtual machines.
Outputs
container_registry_name: The name of the container registry.
container_registry_login_server: The login server for the container registry.
container_registry_admin_username: The admin username for the container registry.
container_registry_admin_password: The admin password for the container registry.
vm1_public_ip_address: The public IP address for the first virtual machine.
vm2_public_ip_address: The public IP address for the second virtual machine.
Clean up
Run terraform destroy to remove all the resources created by this code. This will remove all the resources provisioned by this code, so make sure you no longer need them before running the command.

What the code does!
-The first block specifies the version of Terraform being used and the required Azure provider version.

-The provider block specifies the Azure provider and any optional features. In this case, there are no additional features being enabled.

-The resource_group block creates an Azure resource group named devops in the West Europe region. A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases.

-The container_registry block creates an Azure Container Registry named agentpool in the devops resource group. A container registry is used to store and manage Docker images.

-The container_registry_agent_pool block creates an Azure Container Registry agent pool named devops associated with the agentpool container registry. An agent pool is used to run Azure Pipelines agents in Azure Container Instances to build, test, and deploy your applications.

-The virtual_network block creates an Azure virtual network named devops-network with an IP address range of 10.123.0.0/16. A virtual network is a logical representation of an isolated network environment in Azure.

-The subnet block creates a subnet named sub in the devops-network virtual network with an IP address range of 10.0.2.0/16. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in a virtual network that you can allocate to resources, such as virtual machines.

-The network_interface block creates a network interface named devops with an IP configuration associated with the sub subnet.

-The virtual_machine block creates a virtual machine named devops in the devops resource group with a network interface connected to the devops network interface. This virtual machine is running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and has an admin user named testadmin with a password of Password1234!.

-The virtual_machine block creates another virtual machine named vm2 in the devops resource group with a network interface connected to the vm2 network interface. This virtual machine is running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and also has an admin user named testadmin with a password of Password1234!.

-The network_interface block creates a network interface named vm2 with an IP configuration associated with the sub subnet.

-Finally, the container_registry block creates another Azure Container Registry named myregistry in the devops resource group. This registry has the admin user feature enabled and a tag of production.
